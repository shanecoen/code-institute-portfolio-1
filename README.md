easily and all interactive features such as the gallery and contact form are very user friendly. 

<br>

### Existing Features:

The Navigation Bar used in this website in used in all 4 pages and is placed centrally at the top of the header image.
It allows for the user to easily navigate throughout the site and it is fully responsive and responds to all screen sizes.

These Call To Action Buttons can be found throughout this website. They are large in size and easily recognisible to the user that they are to be clicked and

<br>

#### Video and Image Galleries:

<br>

* Videos

There is a large embedded video included in both Colombia.html and peru.html. These tourism videos are embedded from youtube are are used to highlight the most popular
travel locations in both countries. These videos are invaluable as they allow the user to see exactly what the various locations are like and they can then contact Shaco
Adventures to organise their own travel arrangements. There is also a video included in the Peru Inca Trail Trek section which shows more adventures that await the user.
All of these videos are controlled by the user via the controls provided (start, stop etc) and sound is optional. There are background videos included also in both of 
these pages which allows the user to admire the location in the background while navigating through the page. The background videos are hidden in smaller screen sizes to
allow for ease of use and to speed up loading times. All videos are responsivelly designed. In the image below: the embedded video can be seen on the left and the Inca 
Trail video is on the right. The background videos can be seen playing behind both of these videos.

<br>

<br>

* Images Galleries

There is a large image gallery included in both colombia.html and peru.html. They are locacted below the embedded video section on their respective pages.
They are responsivelly designed i.e. images appear in just one column when in mobile screen view and four when in desktop view. A number of images are hidden
in mobile view to allow for easier navigation. These images include a variety of amazing loctions for which the user can contact Shaco Adventures for information 
and/ or to declare their interest in taking part in an upcoming trek. When each image is hovered over its location will appear and clicking on these will take
the user to a differnt website with more information (these links will open in new tabs). Below a number of images can be seen showing the gallery on various 
screen sizes. (Left = Desktop screen, center = tablet and right = mobile).

<br>

<br>

#### The Contact Form:

<br>

This can be found on the contact.html page and there are also quick links located to this on colombia.html and peru.html. This form is used to allow the user to contact 
Shaco Adventures if and when they require any information on a number of locations in Colombia or Peru. It also allows them to notify the company of their interest
in an upcoming Inca Trail or Lost City trek. The user sends on their information via input fields in this form and any info they require on specific locations can be chosen
via the select and radio button options. Below a number of images can be seen showing the contact form on various 
screen sizes. (Left = Desktop screen, center = tablet and right = mobile).

<br>

### Future Features:

<br>

* In the future I wish to expand on the information provided in the individual country sections (colombia.html and peru.html). I would like to provide much more information
and images for each individual location in these countries i.e. in peru locations such as Cusco, Arequipa, Huachachina and Lake Titicaca. At present there are photos of some of these locations and an external link for more info but I would like to provide all of this via the Shaco Adventures website.

* I would like to add additional Trek options and information such as for The Colca Canyon and Amazon Jungle Treks. Giving these trek options would entice more people to do 
business with Shaco Adventures.

* I would like to expand into other countries in South America also such as Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Chile.

* I would like to incorporate a shop section into the website where customers could purchase supplies for their upcoming trips and treks.

* I would like to introduce a blog section where tips would be given for futre trekkers about how to prepare for treks, what they need etc. This blog would be an essential guide
for all website users.

<br>

### Website Responsiveness:

<br>

This website has been tested at every single stage to ensure that is responded correctly to every device type and size i.e. desktop, tablet and mobile. Some of the device types used for testing included; lenovo IdeaPad 100 Laptop, Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet, Amazon Fire 6 inch tablet, Apple iPad 9.7 inch and a number of mobile phone brands such as Apple iPhone, Samsung and Huawei. Google Chrome DevTools and Firefox's responsive design mode were used etensivelly in these tests. Media queries were used in this websites design where required to ensure that every aspect responded as desired with regard to image rendering, layout, positioning etc. All responsiveness testing passed successfully.

<br>

### Browser Compatability:

<br>

This website was tested extensivelly using a number of different browsers (i.e. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge) throughout its development. This was done to ensure that every aspect of the websites design, appearance, functionality and responsivness was compatible with these browsers.
Note: Safari was not available to me during this browser compatability testing.

<br>

### Additional Testing - Lightouse:

<br>

While testing this website, good use was made of Chrome Dev Tools. One feature that was used extensivelly was "Lighthouse". This is a tool thats is used to identify and fix common problems that can affect the sites performace, accessibility and user experience. It can generate a report (on both mobile and desktop devices) and give a score out of 100 on website perfromace (site loading performace), Accessibility, Best practices (does it conform to industry best practices) and SEO (is the site optimised for search engine result rankings). This was a very useful tool that helped to identify and resolve any bugs present from an early stage. The below image shows some of this websites current lighthouse scores with the left image showing colombia.html on a mobile device and peru.html on a desktop screen.

### Known Bugs:

<br>

* Resolved Bugs

<br>

1. To be completed
2. To be completed

<br>

* Unresolved Bugs

<br>

1. Due to the limitations of the content taught in this section of the Code Institute course my form on contact.html does not work correctly once the submit button is clicked (i.e. the data does not push anywhere). This is an issue that would be resolved once I progress further into the course.
